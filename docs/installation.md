# How to install RBNS pipeline dependencies

## Python

It is highly recommended that you use python through [Conda](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html).

## Weblogo

The easiest way to obtain [Weblogo](http://weblogo.threeplusone.com/manual.html) is via pip:

pip install weblogo

Weblogo must be able to be called from the command line. 'pip install weblogo' will automatically add it to your conda bin, but if you install it stand-alone, be sure to add weblogo executable to your $PATH.
